disk format:
    header block
    usage bitmap
    mapping blocks
    data blocks

the partitions are laid out contiguously on the mapping blocks,
in the order they are defined in the header block.

the maximum number of partitions is 61.

the last mapping block is zero-padded.

header block (512B):
    magic number "PART0000"
    uint64_t number of blocks in device
    uint64_t block size
    repeated:
        uint64_t number of blocks in this partition (0 if no partition defined)

usage bitmap:
    packed bits, each one representing a physical block.
    1 if used, 0 if free.

mapping blocks:
    repeated:
        uint64_t physical block location, or 0 if unmapped
